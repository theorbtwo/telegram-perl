Get http://github.com/vysheng/tg, compile it.  In bin directory, you
will find tlc.  Use it to compile .tl files to .tlc files, which can
then be fed into tldc.pl.  

The tlc for tl is, unfortunately, not there, but you can find it at
https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/TL-tl

There are several bits of tl that are, unfortunately, not in the 'tg' repo.
